**VT Hash Check** ("VTHC") is a Windows Explorer context menu extension that allows you to query the Virus Total malware scanning service simply by right-clicking on a file. If the file has already been scanned by Virus Total then the most recent results are displayed, otherwise VTCH will allow you to upload the file for analysis.
