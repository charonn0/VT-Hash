1. Purpose
The purpose of this program is to quickly check the MD5, SHA1, or SHA256 checksum of a given file against the checksum database of VirusTotal.com. If the checksum matches a file already scanned by VirusTotal.com then the results of 40+ anti-virus scanners are shown.

2. Installing
To install the program, run the setup.exe file.

3. Using

As of version 0.85, you will need an API key from Virus Total to use VT Hash Check. If you prefer to not get an API key, then you must use an earlier version of the program. Earlier versions are not supported and won't have any bugs fixed in them. An API key is free with a Virus Total Community account (which is also free.) Sign up at: http://www.virustotal.com/vt-community/register.html

VT Hash Check will ask you for your API key the first time you run it. 

To use the program, once installed, simply right-click on any file in Windows Explorer and choose "Check Hash" from the context menu.

Settings may be modified by running the vthash.exe program directly (i.e. without arguments) or by selecting the "Settings" item from the "Tools" menu. VT Hash Check can also be configured to automatically save all scan results to a directory. You may specify the directory and the save format in the settings window.

4. Uninstalling
To uninstall, either click "Remove" from the Add/Remove Programs control panel applet or execute the unins000.exe file from the program's installation directory.

5. Misc Notes
Virus Total is a free service provided by Google. Boredom Software is not affiliated with them in any way. Hence, they should not be contacted with support questions regarding VT Hash Check.

VirusTotal, and this program by extension, is not substitute any antivirus software installed in a PC, as it only checks individual files on demand. It does not offer real-time protection.

Although the detection rate afforded by the use of multiple antivirus engines is far superior to that offered by just one product, these results DO NOT guarantee the harmlessness of a file.

This program is in compliance with the terms and conditions set forth on the VirusTotal.com website as of the date of this writing. However, you, the user, should review the Terms and Conditions at http://www.virustotal.com/privacy.html before using this program.
