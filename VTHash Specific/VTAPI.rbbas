		                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
		
		 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
		 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
		 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
		
		
		  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
		the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
		License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
		
		  0. Additional Definitions.
		
		  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
		General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
		General Public License.
		
		  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
		other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
		
		  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
		by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
		Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
		of using an interface provided by the Library.
		
		  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
		Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
		with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
		Version".
		
		  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
		Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
		for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
		based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
		
		  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
		object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
		and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
		Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
		
		  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
		
		  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
		without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
		
		  2. Conveying Modified Versions.
		
		  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
		facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
		that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
		facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
		version:
		
		   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
		   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
		   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
		   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
		
		   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
		   this License applicable to that copy.
		
		  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
		
		  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
		a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
		code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
		material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
		layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
		(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
		
		   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
		   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
		   covered by this License.
		
		   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
		   document.
		
		  4. Combined Works.
		
		  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
		taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
		portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
		engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
		the following:
		
		   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
		   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
		   covered by this License.
		
		   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
		   document.
		
		   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
		   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
		   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
		   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
		
		   d) Do one of the following:
		
		       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
		       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
		       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
		       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
		       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
		       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
		       Corresponding Source.
		
		       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
		       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
		       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
		       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
		       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
		       Version.
		
		   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
		   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
		   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
		   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
		   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
		   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
		   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
		   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
		   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
		   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
		   for conveying Corresponding Source.)
		
		  5. Combined Libraries.
		
		  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
		Library side by side in a single library together with other library
		facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
		License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
		choice, if you do both of the following:
		
		   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
		   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
		   conveyed under the terms of this License.
		
		   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
		   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
		   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
		
		  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
		
		  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
		of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
		versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
		differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
		
		  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
		Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
		of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
		applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
		conditions either of that published version or of any later version
		published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
		received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
		General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
		General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
		
		  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
		whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
		apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
		permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
		Library.

		All public functions of this module correspond to an actions available 
		through the public VirusTotal API v.2. All interactions with the API require an
		API key. 
		
		The Virus Total API returns JSON. Luckily, REALstudio has shipped with built-in 
		JSON support since RS2011r2. All the public functions of this module, therefore, 
		return JSONItems (or Nil, on error.)
		
		If the returned JSONItem was not Nil, then LastResponseCode and 
		LastResponseVerbose correspond to the response_code and verbose_msg members 
		of Virus Total's response. 
		
		If the returned JSONItem was Nil, and it was because of a socket error, then 
		LastResponseCode and LastResponseVerbose correspond to the RB socket error 
		number and a brief error message. 
		
		If the returned JSONItem was Nil, and it was because of a JSON error, then 
		LastResponseCode is VTAPI.INVALID_RESPONSE and LastResponseVerbose is a 
		brief error message.
